# System-Administration
This project tests the understanding of Python scripting for system administration tasks. I developed a Python script using one-level subcommands, with each subcommand handling a specific system-level operation. Tasks include automating backups, user management, file organization, and monitoring system health on a CentOS 9 virtual machine.
